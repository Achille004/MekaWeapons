# Mekanism: Weapons
Add 2 weapons for [Mekanism](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mekanism).

Both highly configurable in config file.

Meka-Tana and Meka-Bow

self explanatory, right?

TO-DO
Add suport for modules in weapons, couldn't manage to work because the rewrite of ModuleHandler in v10.1
personal goal: render both meka weapons behind player model using an api or something that i don't know how to.
